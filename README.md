## This code contains the results of the data challange. 

Questions asked are:
 
 - build a model to predict the likelihood of a late return of any book at checkout time? 
  The project consists of files which deals with data wrangaling, data visualization and models for predicting possibility of late return

 - Are there any factors you can find that are connected with late returns?  
 
  Yes. I find that distance bwteen the library and the customer is most important factor in determining the possibility of late return.
 
 - What would you recommend the library do to mitigate the risks you find? 
  
  I recommend the libraries to prioratize renting books to the local customers, particularly those customers which lives with in 
  2-3 miles from the library. 
 
 - How would you present your findings to them to get buy-in?
 
 I have made a presentation descibing my findings and recommendations. I feel if these recommendations are considered it will reduce the late 
 returns significantly.
